# 4 Non-devs

## Intro

Documentation to explain for non developer how to install the basic tools and setup Git with Github so that you can clone and run Javascript projects.

Fairly simple concept, however I'm not working with developers but people that could have absolutely no knowledge of any of those things. For that reason, I'm trying to explain in the most concise way using a familiar language, so that I don't have to keep going on meets and doing this shit step by step with them, _Capiche?_.

### Observation

If you're familiar with those tools or you don't understand _Portuguese_, don't even bother using this.

## Outro

This documentation was built using Nextra and Tailwind.
